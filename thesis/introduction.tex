Modern industrial applications include a broad range of requirements, far
exceeding the traditional control and automation tasks. Buzzwords like
\emph{Industry 4.0} or the \emph{Internet of Things} emphasize this growing
demand of features. While a typical control system interfaces with simple
sensors and actuators, modern applications require more sophisticated features
like network connectivity, integration into enterprise systems or device
interoperability. To accommodate these new challenges and since the nowadays
dominating \ac{PLC} reaches its limits, the \ac{PAC} was introduced as the
next generation of control. It combines the reliability and robustness of a
\ac{PLC} with the advanced software capabilities of a PC. By incorporating
state-of-the-art embedded technology like \acp{FPGA} and its integration with
general purpose processors on a single chip, these devices eliminate the need
for an expensive custom hardware and allow  the use of \ac{CTOS} components,
without loosing the benefits of executing time critical control functions
directly in silicon.

Unfortunately, the increasing complexity of such systems introduces new
challenges and demand convenient programming methods abstracting from the
underlying low-level components to make these devices accessible to a broad
range of developers. Classical ladder logic used for \acp{PLC} reaches its
limits and \ac{FPGA} technology is restricted to hardware designers capable of
handling low level programming languages like VHDL. Because of its acceptance
in the field of software engineering and its eligibility to model embedded
systems composed of concurrently running tasks, the multithreaded approach
seems to be suitable as a convenient programming model for these hybrid
devices.

In this thesis, the ReconOS programming model should be applied 

\begin{itemize}
\item \acp{PLC} dominate market of automation and control
\item Growing demands show limits of \acp{PLC} (Web-based, database, ...)
\item For 20 percent of advanced applications (rest only small, low cost)
\item PCs arrive, not suitable (OS not stable, rugged environment, complexity)
\item $\Rightarrow$ live without functionality or combine PC and PLC
\item \acp{PAC} as combination of PLC and PC
\item Custom hardware goes away (incorporation of FPGAs)
\item Complex system, hardware software boundary
\item abstraction of hardware and software
\item multithreaded programming model
\item ReconOS as framework for hybrid multi-core systems
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Background for PAC and ReconOS
\item Improvements on ReconOS for PAC
\item Ease of programming by HLS
\item Demonstrator to show feasability
\end{itemize}
