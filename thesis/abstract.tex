\begin{abstract}
Modern industrial applications include a broad range of requirements, far
exceeding the traditional control and automation tasks. To accomodate these
new challenges, the so-called Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) was
introduced, combining the advantages of traditional PLCs and PCs. The recent
versions additionally incorporate custom hardware implemented on an FPGA for
high-performance or low-latency tasks. The goal of this master project is to
develop an adaptive PAC, based on a heterogeneous reconfigurable
hardware/software architecture (ReconOS), with a focus on communication,
programmability and self-adaption strategies.
