\begin{abstract}
Modern industrial applications include a broad range of requirements, far
exceeding the traditional control and automation tasks. To accomodate these
new challenges, the so-called \ac{PAC} was introduced, combining the
advantages of traditional \acp{PLC} and \acp{PC}. The recent versions,
additionally, incorporate custom hardware for high-performance or low-latency
tasks, implemented on an \ac{FPGA}. The goal of this master project is to
develop an adaptive PAC, based on a heterogeneous reconfigurable
hardware/software architecture (ReconOS), with a focus on communication,
programmability and self-adaptation strategies.
