\section{\aclp{PAC}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \acp{PLC} dominate market of automation and control
\item Growing demands show limits of \acp{PLC} (Web-based, database, ...)
\item For 20 percent of advanced applications (rest only small, low cost)
\item PCs arrive, not suitable (OS not stable, rugged environment, complexity)
\item $\Rightarrow$ live without functionality or combine PC and PLC
\item \acp{PAC} as combination of PLC and PC
\item Custom hardware goes away (incorporation of FPGAs)
\item Complex system, hardware software boundary
\item abstraction of hardware and software
\item multithreaded programming model
\item ReconOS as framework for hybrid multi-core systems
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Background for PAC and ReconOS
\item Improvements on ReconOS for PAC
\item Ease of programming by HLS
\item Demonstrator to show feasability
\end{itemize}

\item Problems (Hard to program, error-prone, ...)
\end{itemize}
\section{ReconOS}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multithreaded Programming model
\item Abstraction form hardware software boundary
\item ...
